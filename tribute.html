      <h2>2022</h2>
      <p id="para1">We met in architecture school at the University of Westminster. We were both in the same class and
        shared the same passion for designing and creating. We quickly became friends and
        started to spend a lot of time together, studying and working on projects.We bonded over our shared love for art
        and design and soon realized that we had a lot in common. We went on a holiday together to Greece and Italy,
        where we explored the ancient ruins and architecture of both countries.</p>
